# Consentis Protocol

A decentralized health data protocol designed to return ownership and control to the patient.

## Overview

Consentis solves the "Data Silo" problem by separating medical data from the permission logic. By using blockchain as a tamper-proof gatekeeper, the protocol ensures that only authorized researchers can access sensitive information, with patients retaining a cryptographic "kill switch" to revoke access instantly.

The protocol empowers patients by giving them complete control over their health data while enabling legitimate research and medical collaboration through a secure, transparent, and decentralized infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Patient-Controlled Access**: Patients retain full ownership and control over their medical data
